4. **Live clock**: Display the current time (HH:MM:SS, 24-hour format), updating every second via JavaScript.

5. **Blog posts feed**: Fetch and display the 3 most recent posts from `https://api.rss2json.com/v1/api.json?rss_url=https://blog.chaioverflow.com/rss/`. Show title and date. Include loading state and error handling with a fallback link to the blog.

## STYLE REQUIREMENTS

- **Theme**: You have full control. Dark, light, colorful, monochrome — it's your choice.
- **Typography**: Use Google Fonts (import via `<link>` tag). Choose fonts that match your chosen aesthetic.
- **Design variety**: You have full creative freedom. Each day's design should feel DIFFERENT from the last.
  - Experiment with different layouts and themes (light mode vs dark mode)
  - Use unique color palettes (neon, pastel, monochrome, high contrast, etc.)
  - Try different typography pairings (serif + sans, mono + display, etc.)
  - Surprise me with the visual direction. It should always look premium and professional.
- **bg.webm integration**: The background video should be a core visual element, not hidden. Adjust overlay opacity and effects to make it part of the design.
- **Responsive**: Must work on both desktop and mobile.
- **Animations**: Include subtle CSS animations or transitions for interactivity.
