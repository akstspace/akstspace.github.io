## STYLE REQUIREMENTS

- **Theme**: You have full control. Dark, light, colorful, monochrome — it's your choice.
- **Typography**: Use Google Fonts (import via `<link>` tag). Choose fonts that match your chosen aesthetic.
- **Design variety**: You have full creative freedom. Each day's design should feel DIFFERENT from the last.
  - Experiment with different layouts and themes (light mode vs dark mode)
  - Use unique color palettes (neon, pastel, monochrome, high contrast, etc.)
  - Try different typography pairings (serif + sans, mono + display, etc.)
  - Surprise me with the visual direction. It should always look premium and professional.
- **Background integration**: If you choose to use `static/bg.webm`, ensure it is well-integrated. If not, design a stunning CSS-only or image-free background.
- **Responsive**: Must work on both desktop and mobile.
